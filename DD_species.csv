It appears to be possible that the species is present only as patchy isolated populations that may represent distinct undescribed taxa; genetic analysis of individuals from India and China revealed unusually high nucleotide diversity (K.L. Tuttle pers. comm. 2024). It is an upland species that has a rough altitudinal range of 1,200 to 3,000 m asl. The only specimen known from China was collected at 2,000 m (Smith and Xie 2008).

For instance, in Honduras it is sometimes killed due to this belief, and is even part of the country's folklore with popular songs (see Turcios-Casco <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is, however, hunted in some parts of its known Andean distribution (Aldana <em>et al</em>. 2006, Castaño and Corrales 2010, Racero-Casarrubio and González-Maya 2014, Tinoco-Sotomayor <em>et al</em>. 2016).

Ruedi (1995) reported specimens of this species from only the type locality on Mt. Rorekatimbo, whilst Musser (1987) collected specimens on the neighbouring Mt. Nokilalaki. The species has been recorded up to 2,300 m asl.",The abundance and population size of this species are not known.,"It is found in mossy montane forests on Gunung Rorekatimbo. It likely occurs in similar habitat more widely, but it has not been found at lower elevations nearby, from 1,000 to 1,500 m asl (L. Ruedas pers. comm), so it may be restricted to higher elevations. This species is a member of the moss forest guild of small mammals described by Musser (1987). There is no information on whether or not it can adapt to anthropogenic habitats.","The specific threats to this species are not known, but many lowland forested areas of Sulawesi have been converted for agriculture, mining, logging and settlements (see Supriatna <em>et al</em>. 2020).

Based on these records, it is estimated to have a small extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,988 km². It is also potentially under threat from habitat loss, driven by logging and expanding agriculture, which has started to encroach onto higher elevations. It could therefore qualify as Endangered under criterion B1, but the limits of its distribution are not completely clear and many montane regions in Sulawesi remain almost entirely unexplored by mammologists; further surveys could reveal a wider range. If its EOO is considerably larger, this would potentially qualify this species for a listing outside of a threatened category. As such, considering the general decline in extent and quality of forest habitat in Sulawesi, and adopting a precautionary approach based on what is currently known, this species is assessed in an intermediate category: Vulnerable (B1ab(iii)).

These losses are attributed to cutting for coastal development, shrimp ponds, and wood (Ong 2002). In addition to the loss of mangrove forests, the coastal waters surrounding shrimp ponds start to accumulate high levels of ammonia as a by-product of the farming; they become silty as sediments become unstable, and the natural nutrient cycling capacity of the system is lost. With a loss of nutrient cycling, coastal waters become increasingly more impacted by coastal development and pollution. This species is further threatened by habitat fragmentation (Larson and Murdy 2010).<br/><br/>Many species within the genus <em>Mugilogobius</em> are popular in the aquarium trade.
