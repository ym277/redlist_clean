      "inia was listed on the iucn red list as Data Deficient in 1996. this was changed to Data Deficient in 2008 because the information available on threats, ecology, and population numbers and trends was “limited” (reeves et al . 2011). however, improved information on all of these aspects is now available and it is clear that the species qualifies for a threatened category. although it has long been recognized that inia die from entanglement (‘bycatch’) in fishing gear over much of their range and that their habitat in many areas has been modified and degraded by human activities in addition to fishing (dam construction, port development, mining, ship traffic, etc.), a relatively new threat has emerged since 2000: the deliberate killing of dolphins for bait in a fishery that expanded rapidly until at least the second decade of this century. that threat has contributed to a precipitous decline in dolphin abundance in the central brazilian amazon and a less certain decline in the western colombian amazon. these declines, and others inferred or suspected elsewhere in the species’ range, are directly due to human activity, and since the human population in amazonia, orinoquia, the tocantins river basin (which includes the araguaia river), and the rest of inia ’s range is growing rapidly and fisheries that cause dolphin mortality, either accidentally (bycatch) or deliberately (killing to obtain bait) are likely to continue not only in brazil but also in the other range states, there is no reason to expect the pressures on the species to diminish unless major changes are made in the political, economic, and human demographic landscape. in a closely monitored index area within the 11,240 km² mamirauá reserve (brazil), the inia population was estimated to have declined by 70.4% over the last 22 years (da silva et al . 2018), a period of slightly less than one generation (24.8 years; moore et al . 2018). the authors and reviewers of this assessment discussed in detail whether extrapolation of a similar decline rate to other parts of the species range would be justified. the only other area with quantitative data on trend is in the amazon mainstem near the colombia-peru border, where williams et al . (2016) found evidence suggestive of a decline in abundance between 1993 (well before the direct killing for bait is believed to have begun) and 2007. although there are no credible estimates of abundance or trend in the vast majority of the species’ range, an overall decline of at least 50% in the total rangewide population over the 75-year (3-generation) period beginning around 2000 is plausible. the two areas for which trends are available together represent a very small proportion of the species’ total range. however, the likely primary causes of the declines in those areas – directed hunting for bait and as retaliation for perceived competition for fish resources, and accidental mortality due to human fishing practices – are present throughout much of the range of inia . other persistent threats that are likely to influence the species' conservation status include habitat fragmentation due to dams and other forms of water basin management, pollution, and a reduction in the availability of prey due to competition with humans. unfortunately, there is no reason to expect documentation of absolute abundance and trends, or the true scale of the threats facing inia , to become available in the immediate future or even in coming decades, and this makes precautionary reasoning in the assessment of status particularly appropriate. based on the above and the other evidence summarized below, it is concluded that inia is Data Deficient due to a suspected reduction of 50% or more in total population size over a period of three generations (75 years) that includes the past and the future (from 2000, when directed killing for bait began to proliferate, to 2075): criterion a4. there is evidence of (i) declines in abundance (subcriterion a); (ii) population fragmentation and the deterioration of habitat quality as a result of water basin management (e.g., dam construction), human demographic changes, and economic development (subcriterion c); and (iii) exploitation – i.e., directed hunting to obtain bait and for predator control, together with incidental mortality in fishing gear (subcriterion d). all of the causes of the suspected reduction in population size are continuing and some of them (those related to subcriterion c in particular) may not be reversible due to the increasing human population and the associated increase in demand for resources throughout most of the species’ range. it is emphasised that if the decline rate estimated for the small part of the central amazon region (mamirauá area) were representative of the entire range of inia , and if declines were to persist, the species would qualify for Data Deficient. because of this possibility, the status should be reconsidered as soon as ongoing research provides improved documentation of trends in population size and extent and severity of threats (e.g., bycatch and killing of dolphins for bait). also, separate assessments of subspecies and subpopulations, regardless of the clarity of their taxonomic status, is strongly encouraged.\n",

      "although this is a widely distributed species on sri lanka, the population is suspected to have declined by more than 50% in the last 40 years (approximately three generations) due to habitat loss at an equal or slightly higher rate. the species is also threatened from persecution as a pest, and minimally from the pet industry more specifically, according to government data, during the 42-year period (1956-1993) the country lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 70% if the last 22 years to the present are included. there is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number of macaques (dittus 1977). since 2003 a new threat has emerged: it involves translocating animals considered pests to unsuitable habitats where macaque survival is at risk (dittus 2012a,b). in addition, there has been a loss of at least 15% of natural habitat in the northern dry zone areas, especially since the end of the war in 2009 and further losses are expected (mattsson et al . 2012). the large-sized protected areas (as well as unprotected ones) in the dry and arid zones provide suitable ecological habitat in less than 2% of their areas: only along the narrow riverine forests for this water dependent species (dittus 1977). therefore, macaque densities in most national parks and other remaining tracts of the dry zone forests have been estimated to be extremely low: at 0.2–0.5/km² (eisenberg and lockhart 1972, mckay 1973, dittus 1977). wet zone habitats ( m. s. aurifrons ) are densely populated by humans and macaques are isolated in fragmented patches and are treated as pests (nekaris et al . 2013). in the montane areas, m. s. opisthomelas is assessed here as Data Deficient. this endemic species is threatened also by the fact that it has no legal protection but is managed as a pest species. in human-monkey conflict situations people are at liberty to kill macaque monkeys, and some commercial air-rifle sellers advertise their products with macaques as targets. the overall empirical profile for the species justifies iucn Data Deficient status. notwithstanding, the public perception of macaque numbers countrywide is highly overblown because macaques are often lured out of the forest towards refuse and crops where they are seen easily. garbage feeding macaque populations can grow exponentially (dittus 2012, dittus et al . 2019). these facts, together with macaque-human conflict (nekaris et al . 2013, cabral et al . 2018, dittus et al . 2019), have misled some people to question the species’ overall threatened status, and therefore poses a political challenge for conservation policy and management.\n",

      "as with other species in the genus, sousa teuszi i has very precise habitat requirements, limiting its resilience and ability to escape environmental and anthropogenic stressors (davidson et a l. 2011). remnant populations are faced with a suite of “largely intractable threats” (ayissi et al . 2014) that either affect them directly, or contribute to the rapid and widening deterioration of their inshore habitats (perrin and van waerebeek 2007, van waerebeek et al . 2004, weir et al . 2011). although there are no empirically derived abundance estimates for either the species as a whole or any of the putative populations, the available information indicate that these dolphins occur in very low and declining numbers throughout most or all of their range. most populations for which any data are available are extremely small and several appear to be isolated. available published estimates indicate that the total species’ population size plausibly falls well below 3,000 individuals, suggesting that the number of mature individuals is less than 1,500 (following taylor et al . 2007). declines have been observed or are suspected for every known population, and continued declines are considered inevitable given the ongoing expansion of all identified threats throughout the species’ known range. bycatch in fisheries, the principal cause of the declines, has been identified or suspected everywhere the species has been studied. directed killing has also been identified or suspected in several areas, and major threats to habitats (including ports) are increasingly prevalent (perrin and van waerebeek 2007; van waerebeek et al. 2004, 2015; collins 2015). ecosystem impacts that compromise vital rates may also have deleterious effects, including increasing the susceptibility of populations’ to environmental stochasticity (moore 2015, weir et al . 2011). appropriate management interventions that limit habitat loss and mortality from bycatch and hunting are limited or entirely lacking across the range, and in the absence of targeted and sustained conservation management efforts, long-term prospects appear grim. the available data for other species in the genus can be used to infer that s. teuszii has a low reproductive rate and thus a low intrinsic potential for population increase (jefferson and rosenbaum 2014, moore 2015, taylor et al. 2007). given the small apparent population sizes, any mortality over and above natural rates is likely to lead to appreciable declines in abundance. moore (2015) estimated that given an inferred generation time of 25 years (as estimated for s. plumbea and s. chinensis ), an average annual adult mortality rate of 5.3% would lead to an 80% decline over 75 years (three generations). limited data for some areas (e.g., congo) clearly demonstrates that non-natural mortality (particularly captures) is high and when considered alongside the scale of anthropogenic pressures, a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations is highly likely. the available information, much of it characterized by high levels of uncertainty, suggests that the atlantic humpback dolphin merits classification as Data Deficient (cr) under criteria a3cd+4cd. for the a criterion, a reduction of more than 80% in the total population over three s. teuszii generations (~75 years) is suspected, with declines likely to have begun with the rapid expansion of west african coastal fisheries during the 1980s, and bycatch likely to increase as new areas are targeted and fishery pressures increase. the reduction has not ceased, nor have its causes – nor is there any reason to think they will in the foreseeable future. the inference and suspicion of the large decline in population size are based on the declining quality of the species’ habitat (subcriterion c) and its vulnerability to mortality in artisanal fisheries (subcriterion d).\n",

      "anguilla dieffenbachii is a catadromous, semelparous species with multiple life stages, and is assumed to be panmictic. these life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the iucn red list categories and criteria (jacoby et al. 2015). ideally, the iucn red list criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, silver eels starting their spawning migration as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but such data sets are rarely available. analysis conducted on fisheries and monitoring data for glass eels, yellow eels and silver eels were reviewed in the present assessment, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. as such, the iucn red list criteria must be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the current best estimate of the population status. anguilla dieffenbachii is endemic to new zealand, and found on both north and south islands, as well as chatham and stewart offshore islands. anguilla dieffenbachii is slow growing, and can be long-lived to a large size, dependent on environmental factors, meaning there is a reduced likelihood of reaching sexual maturity, longer exposure to threats, and increased vulnerability to certain threats (e.g. ease of capture). catch per unit effort (cpue) data are available for a. dieffenbachii from both the north island and south island, where catch is of yellow eels—there is no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of silver male a. australis from te waihora (beentjes and dunn 2013, beentjes and mckenzie 2017). on both islands, cpue initially declined since data gathering began in 1990–91, before increases or no trend were seen in the north island after 2002 and increases in the south island after introduction of the quota management system (qms) in 2000. the introduction of total allowable catch (tac) and total allowable commercial catch (tacc) were believed to contribute to the cpue increases seen in the north island, as well as other contributors, such as low market prices, reduction in number of fishers and processing factories, increased escapement tube sizes, and voluntary non-targeting. models have shown only a few females survive to spawn even at relatively low rates of fishing pressure, with reductions in spawning per recruit of 83% and 96.5% from unfished levels, at an annual exploitation rate of 5% and 10%, respectively (hoyle and jellyman 2002). as such, a. dieffenbachii are particularly Data Deficient to over-exploitation. a number of data sources have suggested a historic decline in a. dieffenbachii recruitment has occurred. in three coastal streams across new zealand; pigeon bay, horokiwi stream, and te maari stream, the average rate of decline in glass eel recruitment was calculated, with a conservative estimate suggesting a decline of 77% between 1980 and 2000 (jellyman et al . 2000). although this was based only on three streams, the positioning of them across both north and south islands (middle and southern north island, middle south island), suggests it would be reasonable to infer the results may represent the status across the country. for the arahura river, models indicated a 5% per year decline over several decades (jellyman et al . 2000). in the waikato river, sampling of glass eels in 2004 and 2005 was compared with historical catches (1970–1974) of glass eels from the same area. the proportion of a. dieffenbachii in sampling from 2004 was 3% compared to 12% in the 1970s (jellyman 1979, jellyman et al. 2009). pre-1995 recruitment data has however been reported to be unreliable (fisheries new zealand 2018), and the most recent data on recruitment, between 1995 and 2015, shows large fluctuations with no consistent trend, suggesting the historic decline has ceased (jellyman 2012, martin and bowman 2016). surveys conducted between 1996 and 2010 to determine size distribution of eels in new zealand found that the proportion of elvers in smaller length classes (50–99 mm) was much lower than that of a healthy size distribution for this species (jellyman 2012, pce 2013). the relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it is generally agreed that it is likely that low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement. the effects of which, due to the longevity of the species, may yet to be seen (jellyman 2009). there are less data estimating the trend for yellow eel and silver eel life stages. records collected from the new zealand freshwater fish database (nzffd) (in crow et al. 2016) identified a decline in an index of relative abundance from 1977 to 2015 for a. dieffenbachii . it has also been estimated that silver eel escapement (t) has declined by 80% from levels in the 1920s to that in 2008 (graynoth et al . 2008b). studies have suggested that a substantial proportion of a. dieffenbachii is located in reserves or rarely fished areas (graynoth et al . 2008b, beentjes et al . 2016) but this may not have always been the case, and the protection achieved by national reserves is not absolute, due to the eventual migration to the sea (mcdowall 1990). habitat loss, resulting from wetland drainage may have also resulted in a. dieffenbachii population reductions. since human settlement in the 1840s, to the mid-1970s, total wetland habitat has declined by 85%, from 670,000 ha to 100,000 ha (taylor and smith 1997, beentjes et al . 2005, pce 2013; jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). a number of sources have also estimated that anthropogenic barriers (e.g. hydro-dams) have reduced access to large areas of riverine habitat, that would otherwise be capable of supporting significant numbers of eels (beentjes et al . 2005, boubée et al . 2008, graynoth et al . 2008b, jellyman and harding 2012). under the new zealand threat classification series, a. dieffenbachii has been Data Deficient. 2018). it is however stated that: \"the panel also notes that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise\" (dunn et al . 2018). it is reported that abundance of a. dieffenbachii is stable or increasing in commercial fisheries, although there is still concern over continuing habitat degradation (dunn et al . 2018). based on available information, a. dieffenbachii has been listed as Data Deficient (en) (a2bd). available data suggest recruitment underwent a sharp decline from historic levels, however; there is indication that this decline has ceased, perhaps as a result of management actions. escapement has been estimated to have declined substantially from the levels in the 1920s compared to that in 2008. further, there has been a significant reduction in available habitat over three generation lengths (102 years). due to the vulnerability of the species and its long generation length, discussions were had as to whether this species falls within the Data Deficient (cr) category, but this was felt not to be warranted, at present. it is strongly advised that management actions relating to anthropogenic threats continue and monitoring and data collection is strengthened to better determine population status. as with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation. assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the zoological society of london from the 5th–9th november 2018.\n",

      "due to ongoing conservation actions, the grand cayman blue iguana population is currently increasing and expected to continue to increase. however, the small extent of occurrence (15.6 km² ) reflects the fact that the species is now effectively restricted to managed protected areas. the surrounding and intervening land, once also occupied by iguanas, is inexorably declining in quality as roads, housing, and other human infrastructure expands bringing associated invasive alien predators (dogs, cats, and rats). the loss of recolonization options may eventually impact the population, hence this is treated as a continuing decline. within the three protected areas suitable habitat is quite restricted. the estimated current area of occupancy is 0.5 km² based on the summation of monitored iguana locations. this area may increase slightly in the next decade, but is currently not predicted to reach one km² (using the recommended grid size of 2x2 km for estimating aoo increases the area to 12 km², a figure which is well within the Data Deficient threshold and very close to the Data Deficient threshold). the species does not qualify as Data Deficient under criterion b2 because it is known from more than one location, and is not severely fragmented. the three protected areas (qe ii botanic park, salina reserve, and colliers wilderness reserve) support the entire three subpopulations, the largest of which is approximately 319 adults in the salina reserve. the subpopulation structure is predicted to remain stable, and the number of breeding age iguanas within the salina reserve and colliers wilderness reserve is expected to increase. future population growth is not likely to be possible beyond a total of approximately 1,000 adults, unless additional protected habitat is secured.\n",

      "recent (last decade) increases in the level of exploitation, especially for the lucrative live fish trade, the catch of juveniles or small females, the life-history of the animal (i.e., large, long-lived, relatively slow to reach sexual maturation and sex-changing), and a limited geographic range are all factors that indicate that this species should be carefully monitored in the near future. this species was intensively fished in the past (at levels nearly as high as those in the late 1990s) in the 1920s but interest waned after a decade or so, which may have allowed stocks time to recover. fishing pressure increased in the last decade. mainly juveniles are included in important commercial trap fishery, with juveniles and smaller adults dominating the hook and line and recreational fishery. male numbers seem typically low which could result in sperm limitation for the species, with further male reduction, resulting in reduced reproductive output: males are readily targeted in the recreational spear fishery. commercial and recreational fishing pressure has increased (there is also an artisanal sector) and catches have declined over the last decade. given the growing popularity of the live fish trade and its appeal for high retail prices, pressure may well grow in this commercial sector in particular, especially if prices increase as the species becomes less readily available. although variability in catches could be due to natural recruitment variation and also to changes in fishing effort; indications are that effort is likely to be increasing for commercial use and data from logbooks suggest that catch per unit effort (cpue) has declined approximately 3-fold since the 1980s (fig. 4.4.d in alonzo et al . 2004). recent declines in landings could be, at least in part, the consequence of management introduced in 2002. the effect of environmental conditions on recruitment is not known. the natural history of this species, including its limited geographic range along inshore habitat, the likely increasing interest in the fishery and the currently unsustainable fishing levels (according to the models of alonzo et al . 2004), together with the difficulties in enforcing existing regulations strongly suggest that this species will continue to decline if stronger protective action is not put into place. in terms of the iucn red list criteria, the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are small enough to qualify this species as Data Deficient except that additional conditions related to these areas being in decline, population being severely fragmented or suffering extreme fluctuations are not met. however, the population has declined, judging primarily by a three-fold decline in cpue. this could qualify s. pulcher as Data Deficient under reductions in population size >50% over the last three generations where the reduction and its causes have not ceased, and based on an index appropriate to the taxon (en a2b). however, as such a large decline is not supported by landings data, and as increasingly stringent management has been enacted since 1999, s. pulcher is listed for now as Data Deficient based on a lesser reduction in population size of >30% (vu a2bd).\n",

      "rationale the global population of the loggerhead turtle ( caretta caretta ) comprises 10 subpopulations (see figure 2 in the supplementary material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (wallace et al . 2010, 2011). as such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the iucn (see table 1 in the supplementary material). at the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. the available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). therefore, the loggerhead turtle is considered as Data Deficient under current iucn red list criteria (criterion a2b). the previous listing, published in 1996, was Data Deficient under criterion a1bd (marine turtle specialist group 1996). results indicate that the loggerhead turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go Data Deficient globally in the next generation according to any red list criteria. however, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global loggerhead turtle population. subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by iucn red list categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see table 1 in the supplementary material). for these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the loggerhead turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. this conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the leatherback turtle (wallace et al . 2013). justification the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion b, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria c and d. regarding criterion a, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (north west atlantic, mediterranean, south west atlantic, north west indian, south west indian, north pacific). these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see table 2 in the supplementary material). the analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Data Deficient category (under criterion a2). the species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the north west atlantic and the north west indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. they showed positive and negative trends, respectively. the other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. for the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; north east atlantic, north east indian, south east indian, south pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the south pacific and the north east atlantic subpopulations respectively. the overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the Data Deficiention of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. however, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. for this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments. assessment procedure: criterion a for marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (national research council 2010). to apply criterion a, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (iucn standards and petitions subcommittee 2014). in the case of the loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the habitats and ecology section below). for criterion a, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. the challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see seminoff and shanker 2008 for a review). abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for loggerheads anywhere in the world. extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (mrosovsky 2003). in the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see habitats and ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. a similar approach was used in the red list assessment of another sea turtle species, the leatherback turtle ( dermochelys coriacea ) (wallace et al . 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the african elephant (blanc 2008). thus, to apply criterion a we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. for the loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years. for the global loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). the index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (table 2 in the supplementary material). the assessment under criterion a was conducted in three steps, as follows. please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details. step 1: we estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria a1-a2). step 3: the past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (table 3 in the supplementary material). five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). the overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (north west indian) where criterion a2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion a2. the past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Data Deficient category under criterion a2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Data Deficient category (50% decline). therefore, the loggerhead turtle qualifies for the Data Deficient category under criterion a2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks). although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (table 2 in the supplementary material). therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. similarly, the global leatherback turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (wallace et al . 2013). criterion b since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (eoo) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). the area of occupancy (aoo) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. since the appropriate scale for aoo is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. in conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion b. criterion c to apply criterion c, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:  adults = nests * nests per female -1 * remigration interval * female proportion -1 . with a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion c. criterion d the number of mature individuals (see criterion c) and aoo value (see criterion b) exceeded the respective thresholds. in conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion d. criterion e although population viability analyses (pva) were attempted at subpopulation level (conant et al . 2009, van houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion e under this assessment. no pva has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition. sources of uncertainty although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (national research council 2010). first, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (national research council 2010). however, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). these values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. however, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring. for the trend analyses (criterion a) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion a2), if such information was available. for further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle red list assessments, see seminoff and shanker (2008).\n",

      "this species is widely distributed in the western atlantic, and it also occurs in the eastern atlantic and on the pacific coast of panama, and has extended its distribution as far northward as costa rica, presumably via the panama canal. the major threats to this species are the consumptive fishery, habitat degradation and loss ( especially to sexually immature individuals of 0 to 9 years) and bycatch mortality. the substantial loss of habitat, large directed recreational fisheries throughout its range, and evidence of regional declines raise concerns regarding long-term population stability. there has been no formal stock assessment of tarpon in any portion of the species' range, however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that populations of atlantic tarpon appear to have declined from historic levels throughout their range (adams et al. in review). although patchy, data on total commercial landings in central and south america show large historical declines. total global landings of m. atlanticus declined 84.5% between 1965 and 2007 (4,600 metric tons versus 712 metric tons), particularly in brazil, and mostly during the early years of that time period, reflecting a drop in population size, not a change in fishery effort (fao 2011). using a generation time of 12.7 years (froese and pauly 2008), the estimated decline in fao landings over three generations (38 years, from 1969 to 2007) is at least 60%. although this decline is driven largely from regional commercial harvest, specifically landings from brazil, the major trends in population are mirrored in landings data from other regions, albeit from a much smaller magnitude. in the united states, this species is regulated and, over the last decade, populations in florida appear to have remained stable; however, earlier records are statistically unreliable. anecdotal evidence from recreational fisheries in florida and texas (pre-1990) suggest significant declines. therefore, we infer that the global decline in abundance is at least 30%. this species is currently listed as Data Deficient under a2bd. additional information about the direction and magnitude of regional population trends will warrant future attention.\n",

      "the reef manta ray ( mobula alfredi ) is a large (to 500 cm disc width) ray with a tropical and subtropical distribution throughout much of the indian and pacific oceans in coastal and pelagic waters from the surface to 432 m deep. the global population size is not known, but some local and regional population sizes have been estimated and are mostly small, at fewer than 1,000 individuals, except for the maldives where the population is estimated at ~10,000. while individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently, consequently aggregations are widely separated with low connectivity resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion. the species has an extremely slow life history, producing only one pup on average every 4–5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) among elasmobranchs. reef manta rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale industrial tuna fisheries. the meat is consumed locally, and they are traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. where reef manta rays are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. elsewhere, however, very rapid declines in sightings records have occurred where they are targeted or caught as bycatch. for example, reef manta ray sightings declined by 98% over a 15-year period (half a generation span) in southern mozambique. where fishing pressure is higher, the reef manta ray is suspected to have declined to the point of local Data Deficiention in many places throughout much of the indian ocean. globally, the suspected population reduction is 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (87 years) with further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2105). the suspected past and future population reduction is based on extremely low maximum rates of population increase, current and ongoing levels of exploitation, steep decline estimates, and reduction in extent of occurrence due to suspected local and regional Data Deficientions, offset only by stable trajectories in a relatively few well-protected areas. the reef manta ray is therefore Data Deficient.\n",

      "while the extent of occurrence of this species appears large (> 20,000 km 2 ), it has very specific habitat requirements and has been recorded from only 11 locations. based on recent field surveys it no longer occurs at three of these, as its preferred natural grassland habitats have vanished under urban sprawl (especially in gauteng around pretoria, and kwazulu-natal around pietermaritzburg). known locations are scattered far apart suggesting possible fragmentation into numerous subpopulations with little gene flow. even at sites where this species occurs it is uncommon, suggesting that population densities are low. its total area of occupancy is estimated at 128 km 2 . many of the sites at which this species was collected historically have been transformed by agricultural practices and other anthropogenic activities. the widespread practice of ranchers allowing livestock to graze in wetlands and grasslands near waterbodies during the dry winter months leads to trampling of vegetation and a loss of cover, which undoubtedly impacts this species negatively as these are its preferred habitats and it is known to spend at least some time foraging above ground. likewise, overgrazing and the frequent (often annual) burning of pasturelands in areas where this species occurs surely reduce resources (cover and invertebrates) that local populations rely on (bronner 2013). in mpumalanga the highveld grasslands favoured by this species have been severely impacted by open-cast coal mining to fuel the south african power station hub; this, together with associated industrial activities, rapid spread of local towns, and increasing human population pressures are likely threats at many locations. other threats include the widespread use of pesticides during agro-industrial farming and the loss of habitat to agro-industrial plantations (diminishing but historically acute). this reassessment of the species confirms its Data Deficient status, with a minor adjustment: in 2008 assessment it was considered subcriterion (b2a) of severe fragmentation, however, a re-examination of the available information concludes that levels of fragmentation are uncertain. therefore the species is Data Deficient due to its small area of occupancy, six locations where its presence is still certain, probable decline in number of locations and area/extent/quality of suitable habitat, and the persistent, varied threats to the population across its entire range. should the number of known locations decline further or if evidence arises of severe fragmentation, it will clearly qualify for Data Deficient status.\n",

      "the marbled cat is listed as Data Deficient although it is close to qualifying as Data Deficient under criteria a and c. the change in status from Data Deficient in the 2008 assessment to Data Deficient must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. despite this, the marbled cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Data Deficient was more appropriate, we therefore report Data Deficient as the view of the majority. current data suggest the marbled cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. it is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. marbled cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. there are no published estimates of population density for the marbled cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Data Deficient under criterion c (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. in summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly ( c . 25%) to qualify as Data Deficient. if future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Data Deficient, probably under criterion c.\n",

      "the baiji is a relict species and the only representative of the family lipotidae (zhou et al . 1978). in the previous assessment (smith et al . 2008), the baiji was evaluated as Data Deficient (cr) (possibly Data Deficient), as abundance was believed to be extremely low, and as the numerous serious threats it faced in the wild were still occurring. the last confirmed sighting of a baiji was in 2002. although the species is generally believed to be Data Deficient (turvey et al. 2007) sporadic unconfirmed reports of sightings mean that the species should remain as cr (possibly Data Deficient), rather than Data Deficient (ex), pending the results of a range-wide survey planned for november-december 2017. the 2008 iucn red list assessment classified the baiji as cr (possibly Data Deficient) based on the following criteria: criterion c2a: there were far fewer than 250 mature individuals, and, if the baiji was not already Data Deficient by 2008, a continuing decline in the numbers of mature individuals could be inferred or projected, and all individuals belonged to a single subpopulation. criterion d: there were certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. the following factors justify retaining the classification of the baiji as cr (possibly Data Deficient) in the current assessment: the last confirmed record of the species was in 2002 and its decline was well documented before its disappearance. the “severe threatening processes” known to have occurred have not been significantly addressed and remain unabated. the baiji was confined to a single, albeit large, freshwater basin, which given the massive human presence there, “predisposed” the species to Data Deficiention. if any individuals remained, their presence almost certainly would have been documented given the strong human presence in the species’ historical extent of occurrence. surveys conducted since the early 2000s, which failed to detect any baijis, have been “adequate and appropriate to the species’ detectability.” the surveys were comprehensive in their coverage and included the use of both visual and acoustic techniques, with state-of-the-art equipment employed by experienced researchers. local reports of sightings since 2002 are unconfirmed. the baiji’s habitat remains highly degraded and unsafe for other riverine megafauna. this is demonstrated by the fact that the yangtze finless porpoise subspecies ( neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis ), which was sympatric with the baiji, has continued to decline and is listed as cr (wang et al. 2013). other megafauna in the yangtze river face a similar situation, including the cr (possibly Data Deficient) yangtze sturgeon ( acipenser dabryanus ) (wei 2010a) and chinese paddlefish ( psephurus gladius ) (wei 2010b) and the cr chinese alligator ( alligator sinensis ) (crocodile specialist group 1996) and yangtze giant softshell turtle ( rafetus swinhoei ) (asian turtle trade working group 2000).\n",

      "the species psammobates tentorius is widespread and still relatively common, but populations are scattered and few and declining at approximately 10-20% on average over three generations, and therefore considered to be Data Deficient under criterion a4ce; it was previously assessed in 2013 (and published in 2017) as Data Deficient. the two subspecies p. t. tentorius and p. t. verroxii are both assessed at this time as Data Deficient, but the third subspecies, p. t. trimeni , is Data Deficient. the range of p. t. trimeni is small and restricted to a few vegetation units of the western succulent karoo, which are under continued pressure. a combined soil and veld degradation index (hoffman et al . 1999) showed moderate degradation for the taxon’s habitat in the northern cape. bourne et al . (2012) indicated that the namaqua district (western northern cape) experiences multiple impacts from overgrazing, destructive or illegal mining, and unsustainable land use involving ploughing of natural veld for fodder cropping, uncontrolled harvesting of natural products, and irresponsible tourism activities in sensitive areas. the same processes occur in the taxon’s southern habitat in the western cape province, which is severely impacted by cultivation and land degradation (rouget et al . 2004). unfortunately, habitat degradation and destruction of the taxon’s sensitive habitat is continuing (schoeman et al . 2013) and may escalate. predictions are that climate change will bring an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall, with increased aridity in the western succulent karoo (bourne et al . 2012). such changes would increase grazing pressure in this region, which is expected to affect the status of p. t. trimeni adversely. it is estimated that >30% of the taxon’s habitat has been destroyed over the past 40 years (1.5 generations) and that future changes in habitat over the next 40 years (1.5 generations) will be at least of equal proportions, with a total reduction in population size in excess of 50%. available information indicates that pied crow ( corvus albus ) predation on this taxon is increasingly severe, with anthropogenic facilitation having led to increased abundance of this species in western south africa over the past three decades (cunningham et al . 2016), making increased predation on p. t. trimeni highly likely, especially in conjunction with the current (and predicted prevailing) south african drought. consequently, p. t. trimeni is assessed to be Data Deficient under criterion a4ce. this taxon was also considered Data Deficient at a tortoise and freshwater turtle specialist group red listing workshop in 2013 (ttwg 2014, 2017).\n",

      "the flapper skate ( dipturus intermedius ) is a large (to at least 254 cm total length) skate that was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of northwestern europe. it occurs from scandinavia to the celtic sea, possibly extending as far north as iceland, at depths of 20–1,500 m but the southern limits of the distribution are uncertain. the range has contracted from most inshore areas of its former distribution, but it is still caught in scottish waters, especially around the shetland and orkney islands and off northwest scotland, and in very low numbers along the shelf edge and occasionally in the celtic sea. the species is targeted and caught as bycatch of multispecies trawl and tangle net fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and upper slope habitat. fisheries data indicate that populations of d. batis -complex (flapper skate and common blue skate ( d. batis ); known as the 'common skate complex') underwent an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of their range around the british isles and ireland since the early 20th century (within the suspected three generation period of 104 years). fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although reported icelandic landings of the 'common skate complex' have declined and current information showing low relative catch rates infer low population sizes. the life history and demography of this species allow little capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries; its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. this has been a prohibited species since 2009 in parts of its range and cannot be landed in european union or united kingdom waters. prior to 2009, there was an inferred steep decline of the flapper skate in fisheries landings and an observed, but unquantified, reduction in geographic range size. it is suspected that the flapper skate has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past three generation lengths (104 years) due to levels of exploitation and range reduction, and it is Data Deficient.\n",

      "this species is listed as Data Deficient due to an inferred past and present decline of its population of more than 30% within three generations (25 years) through habitat loss and hunting throughout its range. the same rate of decline is also inferred in the future. just in 2015 in peru, the species' habitat suffered massive deforestation of ~157,000 ha (serfor 2017). in the loreto department border with colombia, the peruvian regional environmental authority a.r.a. (autoridad regional ambiental), granted permits for commercial timber extraction in 11 localities allowing the deforestation of more than 22,000 ha of amazon rainforest (a.r.a, 2016, 2017). one of the main concerns is that tree species that are part of these permits include most of the nesting trees used by aotus nancymaae , such as maquira coriaceae , calycophyllum spruceanu , hura crepitans , eschweilera coriacea , ficus insipid , manilkara bidentata , among others (a.r.a. 2016, 2017). the loss of nesting habitat may have longer‐term impacts on a. nancymaae population recovery if it becomes a limited resource (maldonado and peck 2014). agricultural expansion in the species' extent of occurrence (eoo) in brazil is also severely reducing its habitat (barona et al . 2010). in 2016 the brazilian amazon lost 660,000 ha of rainforest and deforestation rates are increasing in acre and amazonas states (prodes 2017) and even these official estimates consistently underestimate true rates of forest loss in remote areas of the brazilian amazon (mildowski et al . 2017). in the colombian amazon deforestation increased by 44% between 2015 and 2016 with a loss of ~70,000 ha (ideam 2017). the species is also commonly found in the illegal pet trade in peru (shanee et al . 2015).  despite the lack of historical information on the population status of the genus aotus throughout its distribution range in the amazon, there is evidence that confirms that the long-term extraction of this genus for biomedical research has negatively impacted wild populations at the colombian-peruvian border. low population densities of a. nancymaae at the colombian-peruvian border (10.46 ind/km²) indicate a reduction in population size owing to the long-term extraction for malaria research (hernández and díaz 2010 pg. 90).\n",

      "leopardus guttulus has only recently been acknowledged as a valid species, separate from the former leopardus tigrinus , due to their genetic uniqueness and differences (trigo et al. 2013a). its current northern limits of geographic distribution are still unclear, but show a large extent of occurrence of ca . 3,287,075 km². however, its area of occupancy (aoo) is rather limited and within the threatened cerrado and atlantic forest domains. considering all available natural habitat in its entire range, the maximum aoo possible would be of only 473,254 km². additionally, given the level of fragmentation and the very small size of some patches, it is very unlikely that the southern tiger cat would be present in some parts of this remaining area. besides, no single species occupies all natural areas within its geographic range. therefore its actual aoo would be much lower than the estimates presented here. the species is almost always found at low/very low population densities (0.01–0.05/km² or lower), especially in protected areas, given the negative impact it suffers from ocelots (‘ocelot effect’ – oliveira et al. 2010, oliveira 2011). thus, most of the population probably occurs outside protected areas, in places under severe pressure from land development/habitat conversion. a population decline in the past few years has also been detected in santa catarina state in brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, the estimated density dropped from 0.25/km 2 to 0.13/km 2 by almost 50% from 2005 to 2013/14, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (oliveira et al . 2008, 2013, kasper et al. 2016, m.a. tortato pers. comm.). if this decline continues, a population reduction of 80% would be expected in three generations (15 years) in this area. in another area the estimated density dropped by over 50% from 0.2/km 2 to <0.1/km 2 from 2008 to 2015, resulting in a population reduction of over 7%/year. if this decline continues, the population would disappear in 3 generations in this area. additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (klink and machado 2005, mma/ibama 2011). other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (oliveira et al. 2008, 2013; baréa and leite 2012, r. leite-pitman and t. trigo pers. comm.). it is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between l. guttulus and leopardus geoffroyi on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the southern tiger cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (trigo et al. 2008, 2013a). a declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of l. guttulus was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (aoo) and typical lower population densities (oliveira 2011, oliveira et al. 2010, 2013). given the likely overestimation of the aoo, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. based on the observed continuing decline in mature individuals of 50% and more in two important conservation areas for leopardus guttulus a continuing decline of over 10% over 15 years (= three generations) can be estimated. due to its low estimated population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals and the high observed population reductions, the species may even qualify for Data Deficient in the near future.\n",

      "analysis of historic and recent published accounts indicate extensive subpopulation declines in all major ocean basins over the last three generations as a result of overexploitation of eggs and adult females at nesting beaches, juveniles and adults in foraging areas, and, to a lesser extent, incidental mortality relating to marine fisheries and degradation of marine and nesting habitats. analyses of subpopulation changes at 32 index sites distributed globally (figure 1, table 1; see the supplementary information) show a 48% to 67% decline in the number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3–generations. assessment procedure: in accord with the iucn criterion that red list assessments focus on the number of mature individuals (iucn 2001a), this assessment measures changes in the annual number of nesting females. because reliable data are not available for all subpopulations, the present report focuses on 32 index sites (figure 1, table 1; see the supplementary information). these index sites include all of the known major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. despite considerable overlap at some foraging areas, each is presumed to be genetically distinct (bowen et al . 1992, bowen 1995) except for the turtle islands of malaysia (sabah) and philippines (moritz et al . 1991). these two index sites are, however, treated independently because of the different management practices exercised by the two governments and the resultant differences in subpopulation trends. selection of the 32 index sites was based on two primary assumptions: (1) they represent the overall regional subpopulation trends and (2) the number of individuals among index sites in each region is proportional to the actual population size in that region. any regional inconsistencies in this proportion may result in a biased global population estimate. it should be noted that a major caveat of using the number of nesting females to assess population trends is that this data type provides information for the proportion of the adult females that nest in any given year, not the total adult female population. however, when monitored over many years, this index can be reliable for assessing long-term population trends (meylan 1982, limpus 1996). in the case of green turtles, which display high inter-annual variability in magnitude of nesting (limpus and nichols 1987, broderick et al . 2001a), using short-term or single-season data sets could misrepresent the actual mean number of nesters over a longer timeframe. to alleviate this potential source of error, we used multiple-year data sets whenever available. however, when single-season datasets represented the only quantitative information for a given time period, these data were used as long as they were in accord with qualitative information from other references. because data on annual number of nesting females are not always available, we also used data on number of nests per season, annual hatchling production, annual egg production and annual egg harvest. when these proxies were used, we converted units to number of nesting females based on a constant figure of 100 eggs/nest and three nests/season/female, unless otherwise noted. these conversions were based on the assumptions that (1) the mean number of eggs/nest and nests/female/season differ insignificantly through time, and (2) efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production are consistent through time. when using egg harvest data, we also assumed that harvest effort was consistent during all years for which data are available and 100% of the eggs were harvested in any given year. we believe these assumptions are accurate, but their absolute validation is very difficult. qualitative information does, however, suggest that they are reasonable assumptions. for example, in the case of historic egg harvest, the same group of people usually harvested the eggs at a particular nesting beach each year, and they typically took every egg they could find (e.g., parsons 1962, pelzer 1972). in the present assessment, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, linear extrapolation functions, and exponential extrapolation functions. in most subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3–generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. if no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, the raw data were used to determine the change in population size. however, when it is believed that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, extrapolations we performed to determine the overall change. linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. in cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, both linear and exponential extrapolations were used to derive population estimates. however, if extrapolations resulted in obviously false estimates, their results were discarded (see table 5; see the supplementary information). generation length. generation length is based on the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (pianka 1974). although there appears to be considerable variation in generation length among sea turtle species, it is apparent that all are relatively slow maturing and long-lived (chaloupka and musick 1997). green turtles exhibit particularly slow growth rates, and age to maturity for the species appears to be the longest of any sea turtle (hirth 1997). as a result, this assessment uses the most appropriate age-at-maturity estimates for each index site. at index sites for which there are local age-to-maturity data, those data are used to establish generation length. when data are lacking, as they are for a majority of subpopulations, information from the closest subpopulation for which data are available are used to generate age-at-maturity estimates (table 2; see the supplementary information). estimates of reproductive longevity range from 17 y to 23 y (carr et al . 1978, fitzsimmons et al . 1995). data from the apparently pristine green turtle stock at heron island in australia’s southern great barrier reef show a mean reproductive life of 19 y (chaloupka et al . 2004). because heron island is the only undisturbed stock for which reproductive longevity data are available (m. chaloupka, pers. comm.), this datum is used for all index sites (table 3; see the supplementary information). thus, based on the range of ages-at-sexual-maturity (26 yrs to 40 yrs) and reproductive longevity from the undisturbed australian stock (19 yr), the generation lengths used for this assessment range from 35.5 yrs to 49.5 yrs (table 3; see the supplementary information). uncertainties in assessment process: as with any assessment based on historic data or small datasets, there is a great deal of uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. the sources of uncertainty are rooted in both the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature green of turtle biology. both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, which can be a common issue when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a green turtle. first and foremost is the uncertainty related to the assumptions invoked for this assessment. for example, if, contrary to our assumption, efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production were not consistent through time, then our results may be biased. similarly, our estimates may be inaccurate if harvest effort or the relative amount of eggs harvested was not consistent through time. in addition, the use of extrapolations may have resulted in erroneous estimates of population change. the potential for this increased when extrapolations were made over long time intervals, when they were based on short-term data sets, or if the start and/or end points of extrapolations were erroneous. uncertainty may also be tied to green turtle biology. in particular, the substantial variability in the proportion of a population that nests in any given year may result in inaccurate comparisons between past and present data sets. for example, if the proportion of a subpopulation’s adult female cohort nesting each year oscillates over decadal or longer time frames, then it is conceivable that our estimates of annual change in nesting numbers do not correspond to actual changes in the entire subpopulation. moreover, if our conversion values for eggs/nest and nests/female/season are not accurate for the specific subpopulation being addressed, inaccuracies may result. lastly, with respect to the migratory behaviour of green turtles, it is expected that each of the index sites included in this assessment represent a distinct subpopulation. indeed, current genetic data support this claim, however, in the absence of complete data for all rookeries, it is possible that turtles moving back and forth between nesting areas in close proximity could have gone undetected. it is thus conceivable that a female could be counted twice. this would, of course, only be a problem when subpopulation size is based on an actual count of individual turtles visiting the beach. although unlikely, it amounts to an additional source of uncertainty in this assessment. population trends. based on the actual and extrapolated changes in subpopulation size at the 32 index sites, it is apparent that the mean annual number of nesting females has declined by 48% to 67% over the last three generations (table 5; see the supplementary information). in addition, it is apparent that the degree of population change is not consistent among all index sites or among all regions (tables 5 and 6; see the supplementary information). because many of the threats that have led to these declines are not reversible and have not yet ceased, it is evident that green turtles face a measurable risk of Data Deficiention. based on this assessment, it is apparent that green turtles qualify for Data Deficient status under criteria a2bd. the key supporting documentation is presented in the tables (see link to additional information below), and the full assessment is also available from the marine turtle specialist group web site .\n",

      "the whitedapple skate ( leucoraja leucosticta ) is a medium-sized (to at least 80 cm total length) skate found in the eastern central atlantic ocean ranging from mauritania to gabon. it occurs on the continental shelf and upper slopes at depths of 70–705 m. this species is taken as bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries and, similar to other skates in the region, is either retained for consumption or discarded. there are currently a number of european and chinese distant-water vessels using trawls and longlines to target demersal fish and shrimp species that reach the depth limit of this species, especially in the northern part of its range in mauritania, senegal, the gambia, and guinea-bissau. while species-specific data are not available, declines in landings of combined skates and rays have been documented in the northern portion of its range. for example, a study of the elasmobranch bycatch of the spanish trawl fishery targeting hake off mauritania, showed that landings of rajids combined decreased by the equivalent of a 75% population reduction of the whitedapple skate over the past three generation lengths (18 years); if landings trends reflect decrease in abundance. however, little information is available on fishing pressure throughout the rest of its range, south through the gulf of guinea. in this region, the sea floor is reported to be not trawlable at depths of 75–200 m and demersal stocks in these waters therefore reportedly remain unexploited which might provide a refuge for this species from trawl fisheries throughout the central and southern parts of its range. further information is urgently needed to determine the level of impact on this species, particularly as deep-water fisheries are expanding in response to declining fish stocks in heavily exploited coastal areas. skate species, including whitedapple skate, are susceptible to overfishing due to their relatively low biological productivity. however, this species is likely to have refuge from fishing pressure across most of its core distribution and range. considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its northern range, and noted declines in landings of rays across its range, it is suspected that the whitedapple skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) due to levels of exploitation in part of its range, and it is Data Deficient.\n",

      "the ornate wobbegong ( orectolobus ornatus ) is an australian endemic species. previous records from papua new guinea, indonesia, and japan could be different undescribed species of wobbegongs. a biologically sensitive species, site-attached within its relatively shallow water range and previously caught in commercial and recreational fisheries as a target species and as bycatch. in new south wales, wobbegong catches combining all fishing methods and fisheries declined by more than 50% between 1997-98 and 2007-08 after which it stabilized to around 20 tonnes. this led to all three species of wobbegongs occurring in new south wales, including the ornate wobbegong , to be regionally listed as Data Deficient in new south wales. however, fishing effort reported as the number of days fished also declined between 1990-91 and 2008-09, resulting in catch rate being relatively constant around 15 kg per fishing days from 1990-91 until 2009. fishing effort and ensuing catch rate should, however, be used with caution because it is coarsely reported as the number of days fished and does not account for the number of hooks used or soak times. since september 2006, wobbegongs have been included in the daily trip limit for a specific list of shark species to one tonne for a 24 hour period and two tonnes for 48 hours or greater. new management regulations in may 2008 introduced a daily limit of six wobbegongs. a minimum size limit of 180 cm for the ornate wobbegong and the banded wobbegong ( o. halei ) implemented between 2008 and 2013 effectively protected the ornate wobbegong since its maximum size is about 120 cm total length. although the minimum size limit is no longer applicable, wobbegongs are no longer targeted to the same extent as they used to because of the trip limit implemented in 2008. in addition, further investigation of the new south wales fishing catches and effort revealed that the catch per unit effort did not decrease as thought in the previous assessment. as a result, there is no evidence to infer or suspect population decline of the ornate wobbegong , and current catches are relatively low and not spread across the species' distribution, resulting in the species being listed as Data Deficient.\n",

      "it is still believed that the most appropriate category for hog deer is Data Deficient a2bcd (past reduction of 50% or greater in three generations, taken here as about 21 years). a detailed assessment of the red list status of hog deer in 2008 convincingly showed that the species had been undergoing a serious and overlooked global decline for decades. those authors provided the following justification which, with few caveats, is considered to still hold true for the 2014 assessment: it is considered Data Deficient, through a combination of population trends across its range (see below). reflecting the ever-increasing proportion of the total native population in well secured protected areas such as kaziranga, despite an ongoing major reduction in occupancy and number of subpopulations, future declines in the total number of animals (a3 and a4) are unlikely to be at rates in the next three generations sufficient for Data Deficient. however, without concerted action, within the next decade or two hog deer is likely to warrant again listing as Data Deficient through a different criterion, b2ac (c through episodic flood-caused mass mortality), reflecting the loss of all subpopulations except a handful in protected areas with effective cohesive interventions against poaching and the wealth of other, habitat-related, threats facing hog deer. currently the area of occupancy is far too high for listing as Data Deficient on this criterion, or even, probably, as Data Deficient. during the mid and later decades of the twentieth century, the global population underwent rapid range-wide reductions, with the almost total loss of hog deer from southeast asia (when it was widespread and numerous in much of cambodia, southern viet nam, lowland thailand and probably plains lao pdr) and massive declines in the terai arc landscape subpopulations consequent upon the conquering of malaria and the influx of people to the area with wholesale habitat conversion and heavy hunting. unquestionably at this time hog deer global population declines were at rates consistent with Data Deficient listing. by the mid 1980s (i.e., the start of the relevant period for a current a2 listing), subpopulations (at least those large enough to influence the overall global decline rate) had gone from thailand and bangladesh and, almost certainly, from lao pdr, viet nam and china. it is likely that many hog deer remained in cambodia, where subpopulations two to three decades ago may well have been in the thousands or even into the low tens of thousands, based on general perceptions of large-mammal abundance and relative wealth of suitable habitat (r.j. timmins pers. comm. 2008), and myanmar, where hog deer was regarded as a widespread and common species of no conservation concern in the mid 1980s (various people per j.w. duckworth pers. comm. 2008). in the interim, the cambodian population has collapsed. although there is a dearth of information on current status in myanmar, there is no reason to assume that such a trend is not also in train there, although it may potentially be somewhat behind cambodia. in sum, the rate of population decline in the last 21 years in the region comprising cambodia, viet nam, lao pdr, thailand, china and bangladesh has exceeded 90%, a continuation of such declines from the 1950s onwards. populations in india and nepal - and perhaps pakistan and bhutan (no recent information traced) - have not declined at anything like such a rate in the last two decades. declines in india are likely to have been more like 30–40% over the last 21 years, although this may be an underestimate (n.s. kumar pers. comm. 2008); even in high-profile protected areas such as corbett tiger reserve, jaldapara wildlife sanctuary and dudhwa tiger reserve subpopulations are not secure. declines have been at least 30% for nepal (h.s. baral pers. comm. 2008). the trend in the population in myanmar and its proportionate contribution to the overall global trend over the last three generations is the chief uncertainty. it was surely numerically large enough to have some influence on the global assessment of decline rate, given the abundance of prime habitat. coupling the continued conversion of habitat to agriculture, the lack of protected areas specifically for the species (in contrast to those for eld’s deer), the uneven success of eld’s deer protected areas in conserving the species even with prioritised support and international collaboration, and the lack of awareness over the plight of grassland biodiversity in the country, as typified by current locations of protected areas, it is clear that whatever the surviving population of hog deer is in myanmar, this is largely due to chance. in no other range state has chance resulted in the survival of large subpopulations: there has been almost regional Data Deficiention in the countries to the east of myanmar, and a fast retraction to reasonably well-secured protected areas in the countries to the west. the current reality for myanmar probably lies somewhere between these two, and, thus, subpopulations have probably declined by 40–60% or even more in the last three generations. combining these inferred regional decline rates, an overall global decline rate in the last 21 years of 50% is tenable. the thai ‘wild-living’ subpopulation is re-introduced into artificially created habitats, and has not been used to influence the assessment; although it is within the species' native geographic range, it is possible that it is not the native subspecies. the sri lankan and australian subpopulations, outside the native range, has not been used to influence the assessment (but seems to be declining anyway). hog deer has not been listed as threatened prior to 2008. this was probably due in large part to a few large, high-density, south asian subpopulations that give the appearance of ‘abundance’, but these are exceptional to its true status, of Data Deficiention across most of its former range and within much of its present range. this is not fully appreciated even at the present time, despite the analysis of biswas and mathur (2000) and subsequent work by biswas across one of the two main range states (india). in the six years since 2008, new subpopulations were found in cambodia, but are probably not too small to have much influence on global population trends. however effective protection for any cambodian subpopulations has failed to materialise, and declines in this short window have probably exceeded 90% driven by unprecedented economic development in cambodia. the situation in myanmar appears equally bleak, with similar current trends in exploitation of preferred habitats and weak protection measures, together with a lack of focus on the species (see also the 2014 assessment of eld's deer). the situation in india and nepal appears to be similar to that in 2008. a recent assessment on northeast india, a major stronghold of the species found large local subpopulations still occur in assam with sizeable numbers in northers west bengal and arunachal pradesh (choudhury 2013). there is a small but secured subpopulation in manipur and scattered animals in other states of the region. however in assam sharp declines have been recorded outside the protected areas such as in lakhimpur and dhemaji districts (chodhury 2007).\n",

      "this species is listed as Data Deficient in light of its dependence on ongoing conservation program to persist beyond the next 5 years, a very limited number of viable populations (five), and large number of small (13 of 20 less than 400) isolated populations. the north america bison population underwent a drastic decline in the 19th century caused by over hunting but has since partially recovered. there has been a modest increases in the number of conservation herds and individuals in populations managed for species conservation and ecological restoration, however, all mature individuals occur within active management programs which if ceased would result in the species qualifying for a threatened status. about 97% of the continental population is managed for private captive commercial propagation; very few of these herds are managed primarily for species conservation and none is managed in the public interest for conservation. herds managed for conservation purposes in the public interest are typically small (<400), and populations are widely dispersed with few geographic situations that provide conditions for natural movements between subpopulations. the total number of mature individuals in wild free-ranging and semi-free-ranging populations is estimated to be approximately 11,248-13,123 and only 4 subpopulations have more than 1,000 individuals, thus making this species nearly qualify for Data Deficient c2a(i). the species is not currently in decline but wild mature individuals could be greatly reduced if current management regimes are changed or removed. this is a conservation dependant species. the current number of ecologically restored large populations managed primarily for conservation (populations exceeding 1,000 and managed in the presence of most natural limiting factors) is small. the species is most limited in mexico, where only one herd may remain in the wild; it is subject to adverse policies when individuals move across the international border into the united states where they are classified as livestock. creation of opportunities for a few additional, large-scale ecological restoration projects is dependent on cooperation between government agencies and non-government organizations. future progress in conservation and recovery of the north american bison will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by federal and state/provincial agencies, harmonization of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organizations, and public tolerance and support of wild, free-ranging bison managed as wildife on limited, large-scale landscapes. cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different agencies or organizations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible. the likelihood of wild bison increasing over the next five years is entirely dependent upon conservation interventions. currently six of the 20 wild herds representing 11,956 animals (63.7%) are anchored by national parks, refuges or sanctuaries. without these large protected landscapes bison would not likely survive and the future survival of american bison would be in serious jeopardy. beyond these 6 herds in protected areas the remaining 14 wild herds are dependent upon conservation actions and management decisions by conservation programs of states, tribes and provinces who regulate the populations to assure sustainability of these herds. none of the 20 wild bison herds would persist without the management prescriptions and subsequent actions of the managing authorities. wood bison are currently protected under the species at risk act and are managed under a national recovery strategy. hence, wild bison (wood or plains) are totally dependent upon conservation actions and protected lands. american bison would not persist without those intensive conservation measures.\n",

      "there has been a significant decline in the extent of habitat and a reduction in extent of occurrence (eoo) due to urbanisation and these threats are ongoing. there have been no recent observations from historical parts of the distribution at gqeberha (die duine) and makhanda (brak kloof and kleinpoort, makhanda) for about 100 years, despite directed searches, so those subpopulations are suspected to have declined to Data Deficiention causing the large decline in eoo, and possibly loss of subpopulations. most of the remaining distribution occurs as a single population, however, the extent of the distribution has been inferred by species distribution modelling and is uncertain due to few records having been collected. nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that this snake occurs only where the few records have been made because probability of detection is considered low, and it therefore suspected that it occurs more widely. a recent occurrence record from addo elephant national park (incorporated into the species distribution modelling) has contributed to an increase in the eoo estimate. a very small portion of the inferred range is within an active mining area (where several recent observation records have been made), but there is a plausible threat of an increased mining footprint as well as an expanding wind farm footprint with a concomitant increase in infrastructure. this snake is therefore suspected to be at five to six locations, defined by threats of existing mining and wind farms, plus expanding mining and expanding wind farming, as well as development of infrastructure in the south of the range, the with the addo area also forming a location. this species was previously Data Deficient. however, re-analysis of the distribution suggests there is no credible threat that could result in just one threat-defined location, and it has been re-assessed on having five threat-defined locations based on the impact of land transformation due to mining and windfarms. in addition, the new record from addo elephant national park extends the range and increases the eoo substantially. therefore, the species no longer qualifies as Data Deficient given that the larger eoo lowers the Data Deficiention risk.\n",

      "hairy-nosed otter originally ranged from myanmar to viet nam and also to sumatra island, and their range is estimated to be shrinking in each country (sasaki et al. 2009). its populations are under rapid decline across mainland southeast asia, through habitat destruction and degradation, trade-driven illegal hunting (poole 2003, shepherd and nijman 2014, gomez et al . 2019) and human-otter conflict. this species is considered to be Data Deficient due to past and ongoing population declines. the species is suspected to have declined by at least 50% or more in the past three generations (30 years based on pacifici et al. 2013) due to habitat destruction and degradation, pollution, bycatch and prey depletion due to over fishing, and illegal hunting. it is anticipated that the current rate of decline will continue into the future and further threaten this species. the most important habitat is assumed to be peat-swamp forests in thailand, viet nam, malaysia, and indonesia, flooded forests in cambodia. they are observed in mangrove and tropical forest. these habitats have been destroyed for development in large scale. in its entire range, the hairy-nosed otter is under increasing pressure due to extensive poaching. in cambodia, around the tonle sap lake and other places, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common. in viet nam, otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, for meat and medicinal use. wildlife trade involving lutra sumatrana as pets was recorded several times in indonesia. in borneo, the destruction of forests for palm oil plantations, and, soon, the anticipated transfer of the capital of indonesia to kalimantan does not augur well for the future of this species. the principal threat to the fauna of the southeast asia is the burgeoning human population, and resultant pressure of this growth on natural resources. lack of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressures on all wildlife species, including the hairy-nosed otter. a combination of all these factors may lead to the Data Deficiention of the species unless appropriate conservation measures are taken soon. owing to the past and ongoing threats faced by the species, it can be concluded that there is a suspected reduction in the species’ population by ≥ 50%, (criterion a2) due to an inferred decline in its area of occupancy (aoo), extent of occurrence (eoo) and/or habitat quality (subcriteria c, d, and e). also, the exacerbation of these threats, due to lack or failure of adequate conservation measures, may lead to an accelerated decline in population by at least 50% over the next 30 years, further supporting the categorisation of the species as Data Deficient under criteria a2cde+3cde.\n",

      "the patagonian skate ( bathyraja macloviana ) is a small (to 71 cm total length) skate that occurs in the southeast pacific ocean off magallanes, chile and in the  southwest atlantic ocean from uruguay to tierra del fuego, argentina and the  falkland islands (malvinas) and is demersal on the inner continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 50–515 m. it is captured in demersal trawl fisheries targeting skates, finfish, and squid. skates are typically not recorded or managed at the species level. for example, in  argentina, there are no species-specific data, but catch-per-unit-effort of rays, in general,  declined in the 1990s and early 2000s.  in the falkland islands (malvinas) target skate fishery, this species increased in relative  abundance in catch compared to other larger species, but there are no  data on absolute changes in density or biomass from that area. little is  known about the chilean portion of the population, but it is captured  there and is typically discarded dead. overall, due to the level of  inadequately managed fishing pressure it is exposed to, declines in skates  in general in some parts of its range, and its relatively small size  that likely makes it productive enough to withstand some fishing  pressure, it is suspected that this skate has undergone a population  reduction of 20–29% over the past three generations (28.5 years). therefore, the patagonian skate is Data Deficient.\n",

      "scarus guacamaia is the largest parrotfish in the atlantic, reaching a maximum size in excess of 100 cm. it is relatively widespread in the western atlantic from bermuda through south florida, the bahamas and the caribbean to venezuela. it is naturally rare, a characteristic that is shared by other large-bodied labrids. it achieves high densities only in areas that are protected from exploitation and habitat degradation, with highest densities recorded in areas that have long been protected from exploitation (e.g., bermuda, bonaire and los roques). there have been significant decreases in species densities recorded over a gradient of fishing pressure, human densities and presence or absence of species protection through marine reserves. densities of large-bodied parrotfish are 10-fold lower in areas where fishing is present than in areas where fishing is restricted (debrot et al. 2008). scarus guacamaia has experienced significant historical declines. in most of its range, this species is still fished, but given its current and natural rarity it is not often caught. this species is also threatened by the continued loss of coral reef and mangrove habitat from coastal development and extraction. based on anecdotal information from glovers reef in the caribbean (d. wesby pers comm 2009), s. guacamaia has undergone local Data Deficiention in the past 30 years. schools of this parrotfish were commonly observed in the 1960s when several of the islands had well-developed mangrove habitats (mumby et al . 2004). this species appears to be uncommon elsewhere in its range. scarus guacamaia is usually associated with shallow waters and in reefs with extensive sheltered lagoonal/backreef areas. there are a number of parallels with bolbometopon muricatum , the largest parrotfish in the in the indo-pacific, currently listed as Data Deficient on the iucn red list of threatened species. intrinsic life history characteristics such as large size, natural rarity and shallow foraging areas render them particularly susceptible to overfishing (particularly spearfishing). both species recruit into very shallow water, sheltered reef and mangrove sites that are increasingly impacted by habitat modification and degradation. s. guacamaia is experiencing > 30% decline and destruction of coral reef habitat which makes up 7% of its range and is exposed to extensive mangrove deforestation in many parts of its distributional range. unlike b. muricatum , which inhabits a wide oceanic basin and could find refuge on isolated oceanic islands in the indo-pacific, s. guacamaia inhabits a smaller oceanic habitat and may not have access to the types of refuge available for b. muricatum . in summary, there are several biological features of major significance to population reductions of this species due to extrinsic threats: 1) natural rarity of s. guacamaia ; 2) large size; 3) shallow depth range (to 30 m) and propensity to occupy, recruit and forage in shallow sites. in addition to the impacts of exploitation, this species utilizes habitats that are increasingly impacted and have experienced significant loss in the last 20–30 years. although significant declines have been reported, the lack of adequate historical population data combined with the rarity of current sightings and subsequent difficulty in coordinating efforts to determine its current population size has resulted in the inability to effectively quantify population declines over time. moreover, s. guacamaia appears to be conservation dependent with recorded densities highest only in areas where protection is present. it is therefore listed as Data Deficient at the very minimum because cessation of conservation measures could result in this species qualifying for one of the threatened categories within a period of five years. we recommend further monitoring of this species’ population and habitat status and a comprehensive analysis of the reproductive biology including gonadal studies to confirm estimates of size and age at first maturity, estimates of age and sex-specific growth rates, and mortality estimates. in addition, a more detailed analysis of demographic and abundance data is needed in order to predict population responses to varying rates of fishing pressure.\n",

      "anguilla anguilla exhibits facultative catadromy (tsukamoto et al. 1998, tzeng et al . 2000, tesch 2003), has multiple life stages, and is semelparous (tesch 2003) and is panmictic across a continental spatial scale (als et al . 2011, pujolar et al . 2014 b ); these life history traits and characteristics made application of the iucn red list criteria challenging. anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater. the iucn red list criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. i n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of european eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). the index data best representing the geographic range of a. anguilla , over adequate time scales to apply the red list criteria , relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (westerberg et al . 2018). while there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. dekker, 2004, kettle et al . 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the european eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. as such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (dekker 1999). therefore, the iucn red list criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate. yellow and silver eel data for a. anguilla have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see habitat and ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see population). both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Data Deficient (en) category. compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (bornarel et al . 2018). the ices recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘north sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ices 2019 a ). it is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ices 2019 a ). due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. sampling for leptocephali in the sargasso sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (hanel et al . 2014). the reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (hanel et al . 2014). this observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Data Deficient (cr). a suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of european eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly anguillicola crassus ); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation. the significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats. eel management plans (emps) have been developed in european union member states after implementation of the eu council regulation no 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the european eel (eu 2007). the regulation set the objective of each emp to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (eu 2007), and that emps would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. a number of management measures are being implemented in line with emps, including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. there remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (belpaire et al . 2019). a recent evaluation of the implementation of the eel regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the european eel stock, as well as the contribution of emps to promoting recovery (european commission 2019, 2020 a ). it was concluded that the regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the european eel and remains a relevant document (european commission 2020 b ). however, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (european commission 2020 b ). although the eel regulation (1100/2007) only applies to eu member states, efforts are being pursued to non-eu countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. the gfcm are currently in the process of negotiating a regional eel management plan (sac 2018). the last working group on the management of european eel (wgmeasures-eel) occurred on the 16–17 th april 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (sac 2019). a number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (musing et al . 2018). in 2007, a. anguilla was listed in appendix ii of cites (the convention on international trade in Data Deficient species of wild fauna and flora) due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in march 2009). in 2010, the eu’s scientific review group (srg) concluded it was not possible to perform a non-detriment finding (ndf) for this species (musing et al . 2018). exports out of, and imports into, the european union (eu), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. however, trade continues within the eu and from non-eu countries within its range to other non-eu countries. in 2014, anguilla anguilla was also listed in appendix ii of the convention on migratory species (cms). the limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. however, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see habitat and ecology). further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. as such it was deemed appropriate to assign a. anguilla a Data Deficient (cr) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (a2bd+4bd). this category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. ultimately the cr category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of emps to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (european commission 2020). continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. a drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the zoological society of london from the 5 th –9 th november 2018.\n",

      "this demersal, migratory species is endemic to the gulf of california, mexico. it inhabits coastal areas and is dependent on shallow water in the upper gulf for spawning and nursery habitat. this region has been altered by the damming of the colorado river in the 1930s, resulting in increased salinity. the estimated generation length is about 12 years. a variety of intrinsic characteristics (e.g. late-maturing, long-lived, predictable spawning behaviour in a relatively small area) make it particularly susceptible to overfishing. an important extrinsic factor, the extremely high economic value of the swim bladder of the species, is a major incentive to catch this species for swim bladder extraction and export. this market pressure is ongoing, if not increasing, and is facilitated by a lack of effective surveillance and law enforcement in the region. although the legal fishery was closed in 1975 due to concerns about overexploitation, there has been an exponential increase in poaching driven by illegal trade in its swim bladder to china since 2011. poaching is highest in the upper gulf spawning grounds, with the preferred gear being gillnet, and has extended south to the archipelago during the non-spawning season. the capture as bycatch of the Data Deficient vaquita porpoise ( phocoena sinus ) in these gillnets has driven this endemic marine mammal to the brink of Data Deficiention. there are no estimates of totoaba population size (defined as number of mature individuals according to the iucn red list guidelines). estimates of effective population size are available, ranging from around 2,000–11,000 breeding adults, but this cannot be applied as an estimate of the population size per the red list guidelines. there is some evidence from genetic diversity and age-size structure of samples that suggests population stability. from 2015–2019, nearly 700,000 captive-bred juvenile totoaba individuals were released into the wild to support population recovery, but further study is needed to understand the impact of these releases. several studies have modelled potential biomass trajectories based on historical commercial catches and more recent estimates of illegal catch to evaluate different management scenarios and the level of effective protection. however, the models are not fitted to available data but rather driven by assumptions about population depletion, so they are not appropriate to apply to a red list categorization, nor to construct an index of mature individuals. therefore, we used poaching severity as the basis for this red list assessment. a precautionary approach is taken here for three reasons: 1) the species has been subject to sharply increased rates of poaching targeting large adult totoaba for approximately one generation (since the early 2010s) despite legal protection and increased enforcement; 2) given the ineffectiveness thus far of these measures, it is plausible that poaching pressure will continue and 3) there is ongoing, if not growing interest to source the swim bladder of this species for illegal trade. we suspect a past and future three-generation decline (1993–2029) of at least 30% based on the following: 1) estimated annual removals of adult individuals by poaching increased five-fold from approximately 6,000 individuals in the mid-1980s to 30,000 individuals by 2017; although, there is some uncertainty associated with these estimates. 2) the total mortality rate of totoaba increased from the mid-1980s to 1991–1993 due to a sharp increase in poaching during that period. while declines may have started in the mid-1980s we have a higher level of confidence in the data that indicate declines starting in the early 1990s. 3)\tin the upper gulf spawning grounds where totoaba aggregate in winter-spring, there has been a 99% decline since 2011 in the sympatric vaquita porpoise population due to incidental capture in illegal gillnets targeting totoaba. given that gillnet poachers search for and target totoaba aggregations, it is plausible that a steep decline may have also occurred in the totoaba population during the same period. 4)\tannual average seizures of illegal totoaba swim bladders have increased by five-fold from just over 500 per year in 2013–2017 to over 2,300 per year in 2018–2020. these numbers represent only a portion of the illegal trade, and are therefore inferred to be underestimates. 5) targeted poaching of totoaba is also evident in net removal statistics, with over 1,200 illegal large-mesh gillnets removed from the upper gulf spawning area from 2016 to 2020. therefore, primarily based on the level of exploitation, this species is Data Deficient. given that there are inconsistencies in the available data, with evidence of increased poaching pressure countered by other indications of population resilience, and no direct measures of population trend, this assessment should be updated when additional data allow for a better understanding of this species’ status, especially since declines are expected to continue in the near future due to the ongoing high poaching rate. the change in status from the previous assessment is non-genuine and reflects an improved application of the iucn red list categories and criteria, as well as improved availability of data. the most urgent conservation need is to stop illegal fishing and trafficking of swim bladders. conservation measures that have reduced fishing by the commercial fleet and provided protections of the spawning ground should remain in place. improvements in fishery data collection are needed as well as research on the efficacy of the released cultivated juveniles to increase wild stock.\n",
      "this species is listed as Data Deficient due to a past and ongoing population decline estimated from loss of available habitat, fragmentation of remaining habitat and increasing loss of individuals due to hunting, road-kills and bi-catches by snare hunters. population declines are estimated to have been greater than 50% in the past three generations (36 years) driven primarily by large scale conversion of tapir habitat to palm oil plantations and other human dominated land-use. the rate of reduction in population is inferred to be proportional to the reduction of the tropical rainforest area in southeast asia over the same period. however the population decline is estimated to be even higher due to indirect threats (roads, hunting). furthermore there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next two generations (24 years). most remaining populations are isolated in existing protected areas and forest fragments, which are discontinuous and offer little ability for genetic exchange for these browsers. this situation is particularly relevant for the thai/myanmar populations and to a lesser extent for the southern thailand and malaysia landscape. this situation is expected to continue at a slightly diminishing rate in the future as non-protected areas, which are available as logging concessions, become less available. because hunting seems to be increasing for tapir throughout the range - this could be cause for concern in the future as already reduced and isolated subpopulations would be at great risk for extirpation. threats due to habitat destruction and hunting in myanmar/thailand appear to be minimal, because most of the population occurs in well protected national parks and reserves. the main threat to the thailand/myanmar population is likely related to negative effects of inbreeding in small isolated populations. the situation is similar in malaysia, although the population sustains a higher risk of habitat fragmentation and, subsequently, inbreeding risks as well as increased changes of mortal displacement. despite having developed a national tapir action plan (2013) the decline of the sumatra population has not yet been arrested, and it remains under serious threat from habitat destruction and accidental capture in illegally set snares.\n",

      "the wolverine is listed as Data Deficient because of its wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Data Deficient. it occurs at low density and many populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (ruggiero et al . 2007). there have been large past declines in some of its range but there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (rowland et al . 2003). thus although there is an overall continued decline due to human persecution and land-use change, the global decline of this species is not at a rate sufficient to qualify for categorisation even as Data Deficient as of 2015. however, in the mid-2000s the european mammal assessment determined that the european populations of wolverine were in steep decline and would warrant a category of Data Deficient (a2c). thus, the Data Deficient global listing is driven by the large populations which remain in northern asia and north america. wolverine still faces some threats such as over-exploitation through hunting and trapping, predator-poisoning programmes and habitat resource extraction that caused the contraction of its historical range. more data on population trends, especially in northern asia, might result in this species being re-Data Deficient.\n",

      "the elusive sunda clouded leopard is found only on the islands of borneo and sumatra, and possibly on the batu islands. although thought to exist at relatively low population densities, the sunda clouded leopard appears to be adaptable, and is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the sunda clouded leopard is forest dependent, and does not readily use oil palm elaeis guineensis plantations (ross et al. 2010, hearn, ross and macdonald unpublished data), although such plantations may not necessarily form a hard barrier to this wild cat (nájera et al. 2013, hearn et al. unpublished data). the forests of borneo and sumatra are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, coupled with the species’ apparent low population size, probably constitute the greatest threat to this species. population density estimates of sunda clouded leopard on borneo, derived from targeted camera trap surveys across a range of forest types and elevations, and a gradient of disturbance, range from 0.8 to 4.4 individuals / 100 km² (brodie and giordano 2012, wilting et al. 2012, cheyne and macdonald 2011, hearn, ross and macdonald unpublished data, loken et al. in prep), a large proportion of which (6 of 10 surveys) provide estimates of under 1.9 individuals / 100 km². additional camera trap surveys on borneo, specifically undertaken to detect and estimate the density of this felid, failed to find any evidence of the sunda clouded leopard, including the kabili-sepilok forest reserve, sabah (hearn, ross and macdonald unpublished data) and several forest sites in kalimantan (cheyne et al. in prep), indicating that sunda clouded leopard presence across the forested landscape of borneo is somewhat patchy. the population density of the sunda clouded leopard on sumatra is less well studied, but four camera surveys undertaken within the kerinci landscape present a similar pattern to that of borneo, with densities ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 individuals / 100 km² (sollmann et al. 2014). a maximum entropy based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and land use covariates, estimated that the sunda clouded leopard’s current area of occupancy (aoo) on borneo is approximately 378,900 km² (borneo carnivore symposium: hearn et al. in prep). such habitat suitability data are lacking for sumatra. for this assessment, an approximate aoo for sumatra was developed from a map of forest cover derived from satellite images taken in 2010 (miettinen et al. 2010). land cover classes identified as suitable habitat by expert opinion during the bornean carnivore symposium in 2011 (peat-swamp forest, lowland forest and lower montane forest <1500 m) were selected and included in the aoo, which amounted to approximately 73,000 km², providing a total aoo of 451,900 km². as detailed below, forest cover on both borneo and sumatra will have decreased since 2010. furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient data, these estimates are unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range, which could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current aoo. acknowledging that our estimate of current aoo may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, and further loss of forest post 2010, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the sunda clouded leopard across its aoo may be as low as 1 individual / 100 km². extrapolation of this estimate to the wider aoo suggests that the number of mature individuals could be around 4,500 individuals, and is thus very likely to be below 10,000 individuals. a gis exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside land cover data for borneo for 2000 and 2010 (miettinen et al. 2010), and the selected land cover classes for sumatra for the years 2000 and 2010 (miettinen et al. 2010) and estimated that the aoo decreased by 33.1% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm plantations. given the strong evidence for forest dependency in this felid, this loss of aoo, coupled with hunting pressure, is probably driving a reduction in the number of mature individuals at the same rate or higher. more recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the aoo (gaveau et al. 2014, macdonald et al. in prep a), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. although the sunda clouded leopard probably spends a proportion of its time hunting, moving and resting in the trees, because much of its time is also spent moving on the ground, sunda clouded leopards are prone to untargeted snaring. we therefore have a strong basis upon which to infer that the total sunda clouded leopard population size currently lies below 10,000 individuals, and that the cumulative reduction in the aoo and thus population size as a consequence of forest loss, degradation and poaching has probably amounted to ≥30% in the past 21 years (three sunda clouded leopard generations, pacifici et al. 2013) indicating a categorisation of Data Deficient under both vu c1 and vu a2c.\n",

      "this widely distributed, demersal species has an estimated generation length of 6-7 years. it is an important component of commercial fisheries in much of its range, including in the sea of japan from the tsushima strait to yamagata prefecture and off the pacific coast in fukushima and ibaraki prefectures. of these two primary stocks/subpopulations of this species, the pacific coast stock is larger than the sea of japan stock. the stock in the western sea of japan is considered stable as of 2014, but recruitment has been low since 2005 and in the tsushima strait region, female spawning stock biomass declined by 45% from 2008 to 2013. this is thought to be caused in part by a shift/fluctuation in water temperature. in the sea of japan (aomori to yamaguchi), overall catch declined by 40-45% over the past three generations (since 2002), and at least four out of the seven prefectures currently report low stock levels. this decline is in part driven by overexploitation of immature individuals. in the tsushima strait (southwestern sea of j apan), the stock was considered to be at a relatively high level as of 2014. on the northern pacific coast of japan in the tohoku region, the stock is currently at a high level. overall, this stock has increased over the past three generations, and most recently (since 2012), the trend has been increasing. regular stock assessments are conducted for the japanese stocks and fishing regulations are in place to promote sustainable fishing. on a global level, it is inferred that this species has declined by nearly 30% over the past three generations, and is therefore listed as Data Deficient, as it is close to meeting the quantitative threshold for Data Deficient under criterion a2bd . cons ervation measures are needed to reduce capture of immature individuals in the commercial fisheries that target this species. more information is needed concerning exploitation rates and abundance trends throughout the entire range of this species. the findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the national marine fisheries service.\n",

      "the shorthorned pygmy devil ray ( mobula kuhlii ) is a medium-sized (to 135 cm disc width) ray with an indo-pacific distribution in temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters. it is a mainly inshore continental shelf species that occurs in coastal areas from the surface to depths of 50 m. the shorthorned pygmy devil ray has a low reproductive output with one pup born, possibly every 1–3 years, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity and be incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devil ray ( mobula spp.) fisheries worldwide. the shorthorned pygmy devil ray is a large component of targeted fisheries in indonesia and pakistan, and was previously targeted in the philippines. this species is also a bycatch component of many small and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated and reported as mobula spp. the lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that populations are declining worldwide. notable declines in landings of 93% over 14 years have been documented at one fishing landing site in indonesia, while at another site, the species was caught in low numbers in 2001–05 but was not recorded in 2013–14. overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devil rays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the past three generations (38 years). less information is available in other regions, but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are in decline as well. however, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the shorthorned pygmy devil ray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020–2058) due to ongoing demand for high-value products, and it is Data Deficient.\n",

      "the red steenbras ( petrus rupestris ) is endemic to south africa and is a long-lived species that exhibits slow growth and late maturity. this species is an apex predator that occurs on sub-tidal reefs throughout its distributional range. although evidence suggests that p. rupestris is highly fecund, this species does not attain sexual maturity until approximately seven years of age. adults are believed to undertake an eastward migration to the eastern cape coast and southern kwazulu-natal where they aggregate to spawn and are actively targeted. juveniles inhabit sub-tidal reefs and exhibit strong site fidelity which may make them susceptible to localized overfishing. petrus rupestris has experienced a substantial range contraction due to the severe depletion of the stock as well as decreases in abundance in areas where this species was once common. the overexploited status of p. rupestris has been recognized for at least the past 30 years and although strict regulations were gradually implemented, stock recovery was not apparent, ultimately leading to the collapse of the stock and the implementation of a moratorium in 2012. there is a need for more precise information regarding the spatial and temporal occurrence of spawning aggregations and the distribution of eggs and larvae of p. rupestris . petrus rupestris experienced a decline in cpue of 84% from the 1930s to the early 1990s in the southern cape as well as a dramatic decline of >75% from 1986 to 1998 on the agulhas bank. the total reported commercial catch for this species has declined from about 75 tonnes (1985–1992) to an average of less than 4.3 tonnes (2001-2007) indicative of a ~95% decrease. in addition, from 1985 to 2007 cpue declined from 1.1 kg/man/hr to 0.5 kg/man/hr. while this later decline may be partly due to the strict regulations introduced to protect this species, much of the decline took place during the latter half of the 20th century and there has been no indication of any stock recovery after the regulations were implemented. in addition, standardized abundance indices provide further evidence for a consistent population decline of 95% in the western cape and 65% in the eastern cape. this evidence represents an overall population decline of at least 75% within three generation lengths (51 years), and the species is thus listed as Data Deficient under a2bd. these documented population reductions, however, are almost reaching the thresholds of listing under Data Deficient, and a thorough evaluation of the stock is urgently needed to determine the current standing of the populations and the effectiveness of the moratorium currently in place.\n",

      "the yellow-spotted fanray ( platyrhina tangi ) is a small (to 68 cm total length) ray endemic to the northwest pacific from southern japan to northern viet nam. it is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 10–100 m. the species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. landings data of all skates combined from the taiwan exclusive economic zone (eez) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the japan, china, south korea, and viet nam eezs indicate declines of 46–96% over the past three generation lengths (23.3–36 years). historic and current fishing pressure are high across the species’ entire range, yet it is abundant and relatively common in parts of its range with a stable population in china over the past 15 years; these indicate that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. dramatic levels of habitat loss across its range are also likely a threat to the species. it is inferred that the yellow-spotted fanray species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (23–36 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is Data Deficient.\n",

      "the humphead wrasse is widely distributed but is nowhere common, naturally. densities rarely exceed 20 fish per hectare in the preferred habitats of outer reefs; more typically not more than 10. wherever it is fished, even if only moderately, density quickly declines to 25% or less of peak densities recorded at no fishing – this is known from 24 different studies based on fishery-independent data from 11 range states (sadovy et al . 2003). it appears to be extirpated from several edge of range locations (sadovy et al . 2003). it is particularly heavily exploited (i.e., high levels of fishing pressure) at the centre of its range in southeastern asia where its coral reef habitat is most abundant, and particularly in key supply countries for the live reef fish trade, malaysia and indonesia, and out of palawan, its stronghold in the philippines. in these countries all available fishery-dependent and trade-related data suggest declines over 10–15 years in exploited areas of 10–fold or more with fish now considered rare in areas where once it was common. buyers of this fish are continually having to source new areas as numbers decline and the pattern of fishing reported is one typical of rapid serial depletions. much of the capture in all major source countries for live fish are of small fish, mainly juveniles, according to all reliable accounts. moreover, juveniles are the preferred size range for retailers of live humphead wrasse. severe declines have also been noted nationally wherever the species is taken by speargun at night. such is the concern for this species that it is one of the only reef fish protected by name (i.e., species name) across a range of countries. it is everywhere accessible to live fish catcher boats which can visit the most remote locations at will. some spawning aggregations have been noted to decline or have disappeared in eastern malaysia and australia. the total global catch of this species is estimated to be no more than 400 mt annually (sadovy et al . 2003), yet despite this low volume, severe declines are noted in all places for which data are available and occurring very soon after fishing begins, reducing numbers by more than 50% (see country accounts and summary table) (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) and where management is not effective. much of the trade is now in juvenile fish which is the preferred market size for live fish. it is severely reduced anywhere that it is fished unless a) it is effectively managed, b) there is no export trade or night spearfishing, and c) it is not included in marine protected areas. it is a species that appears to be highly conservation-dependent . there is no regional fishery management authority for this species and fao does not collect data on it. the listing of this species as Data Deficient is based on a population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations (approximately 30 years) based on an index of abundance and actual or potential levels of exploitation (a2bd). the declines are predicted to continue or even accelerate because of the likely growth of the live fish export trade (a3bd). this species can live at least 30 years (25 for males and 32 for females) and becomes sexually mature at six years (j.h. choat, c.r. davies, j. ackerman and b.d. mapstone, unpublished manuscript). this means that its generation time is expected to be in the order of 10 years and that the rate of intrinsic population increase is likely to be low; natural predators are few and natural mortality rate was determined to be 0.14 or less (j.h. choat, c.r. davies, j. ackerman and b.d. mapstone, unpublished manuscript). the species is particularly Data Deficient because the bulk of the fishery for live fish, at least in east malaysia, southwest philippines and indonesia (the major suppliers for the live reef fish trade and the centre of the species’ range) is selective for juvenile sized fish since this is the preferred size class for consumers and gains the highest prices. this selective fishery for animals below but close to the size of sexual maturation has the potential to severely reduce the reproductive capability of exploited populations.  the species cannot be artificially cultured (i.e., hatchery produced) to relieve fishing pressure. the declines are projected to continue or worsen in key source countries for live fish because: a) the species is one of the two most highly valued fish, economically, in the luxury live reef fish trade on a per kg basis; b) of the probable intrinsic vulnerability of such a large and long-lived reef fish, that is also hermaphroditic with relatively few adult males, and an aggregation-spawner, to overfishing; and c) in places where the species has declined but is still actively sought, fishers only find a few fish a month or a year, at most; d) the projected growth in the live fish trade, especially into mainland china in the next few years. finally, despite regulations in many places, there is much illegal, unregulated and unmonitored trade, according to many verbal accounts by fishers and traders and there is no regional management authority actively engaged in managing this small fishery and fao does not collect data on it. it only remains abundant where protected or not fished at all. protective legislation in most places appears to be ineffective. see the supplementary material for a summary of the population data derived from fishery-indepent and fishery dependent sources.\n",

      "gharial were historically distributed throughout the major channels of the indus, ganges, mahanadi, brahmaputra-meghna and possibly irrawaddy drainages, to elevations of <500 m, an estimated combined linear river distance of >20,000 km, or an historic occupancy area of 80,000 km² (using red list standard 4 km² resolution). the species is currently extirpated from the indus, irrawaddy and most rivers and tributaries of the ganges and brahmaputra-meghna systems, but persists in fourteen sites within the ganges drainage (6 major and 8 minor), with confirmed breeding at only five locations (table 1 in the supplementary information). surveys and counts in 2010-2017 indicate an adult global metapopulation conservatively estimated at 650 (median) with a range of 300-900.  the largest and most populous location, the protected national chambal sanctuary in north india, spans 625 river km, with approximately 500 mature adults, comprising 77% of the global total, producing >410 nests annually, or >86% of the global total.  five other locations reporting breeding are small and highly disturbed.  the remaining 8 minor locations together contain less than 10% of the world population (<50 mature adults), with no recent breeding. during the next decade, gharial will likely be extirpated from some of the minor/non-breeding sites, including three sanctuaries in india designed for their protection (son, ken, satkosia gorge), as well as the padma-jamuna, brahmaputra-meghna, and bhagirathi-hooghly drainages, based on the infrequent sightings in these regions. generation time is estimated at 25 years giving a period of decline of 75 years or since 1943. cause of declines have been principally dams and barrages disrupting river hydrology, mortality in fishing nets, and historically, unregulated hide-hunting. current serious threats include major water control and extraction activities, mortality in fishing gear, and increased anthropogenic river-bank disruptions, especially sand mining and boulder removal.  these threats are known, continuing and not reversible, therefore criterion a2 applies. the expansion of threats and major declines have intensified since the 1950s, and continue presently with increasing demand for river resources. past population levels are inferred to be >20,000 adult gharial globally.  calculating across the range of current and past population estimates, exponential declines are 94% or greater. even a very conservative calculation of 5,000 in 1943 and 1,000 currently gives a decline of 80%.  decline in 3 generations is confidently inferred to exceed the criterion a2bc 80% for Data Deficient. toxins/pollutants were strongly suspected to play a role in the death of >110 gharial in the size range of 2-4m during the winter of 2008-2009 on the lower chambal (whitaker et al . 2008), and possibly the loss of additional gharial in 2012 (<10-15 individuals; nair et al . 2013).  this initial major loss suggested a species-specific sensitivity to whatever caused the deaths, which were localized geographically, most occurring rapidly within 2-15 weeks.  these deaths were related to articular and visceral gout, related to kidney failure, associated with low ambient temperatures.  despite the absence of a re-occurrence, the susceptibility of gharial to whatever resulted in gout in the first instance warrants the application of criterion a2e. extent of occurrence (eoo) exceeded 80,000km² historically. area of occupancy (aoo) is generously estimated for the six major locations with sizeable resident populations at 4,400 km², a reduction of 94%. a population estimate of 300-900 mature individuals meets criterion c1 for Data Deficient if we infer that the decline is continuing at a rate of at least 20% in two generations/50 years i.e. since 1967. gharial meets criterion d1 Data Deficient (population size <1,000 mature individuals). the species does not meet criteria e.\n",
